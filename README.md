# Introduction
I provide my solution to Gilded Rose Refactoring Kata.

Check full documentation for task:
[GildedRose Refactoring Kata](https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata)

* I choosed to split all products to different classes and put specific product logic into specific product class.
* I minimized the code and made it easy to read.
* Child classes inherit parent class logic.
* I made actions class where I put actions logic.

I would like to make Item class with setters & getters, but in documentation wrote, that i can't do it and I left it how it is.
